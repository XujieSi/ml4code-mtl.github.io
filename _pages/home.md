The research in the ML4Code @MTL group is broadly concerned with using machine learning to support writing, reasoning, and maintaining source code and related artifacts such as documentation. We are also interested in program synthesis, out-of-distribution generalization for programs, probabilistic programming and other applications of source code like code autocompletion, code search, program verification, etc. Some of us also like to work at the intersection of the above mentioned areas and reinforcement learning, natural language processing and functional programming.  

The small community of researchers in our group are primarily form [Mila](https://mila.quebec), [SOCS McGill](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca) and [Google Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain/). We host meetings biweekly from 12-1 pm on Tuesday. Check out our [current schedule](/meetings/). We would love to have you here!
